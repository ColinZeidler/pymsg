#PYMSG

a basic client server command line chat client written in python

##Running

To start the server:
>python server.py

To connect to a server:
>python client.py

>python client.py {IP of server}

If no IP is specified on the command line, then the app will prompt for an IP during startup.
If there is still no IP given at that point it will default to localhost
